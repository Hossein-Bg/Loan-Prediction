# Loan Prediction

In a data science project involving loan prediction, you will have to predict whether or not a loan will get approved. Before starting this project, it is important to understand that among all industries that use data science, the insurance domain makes use of analytics and methods of data science on a very large scale. Before you begin working on this project, you must know how the industry works, the challenges it faces, and the strategies that are used.

✅ What is a loan prediction system?
A mechanism called the Loan Prediction System allows you to apply for loans and receive notifications when they are approved. By the data provided by the applicant, the system notifies the applicant of the loan's availability.

✅ What is Numpy?
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.It also has functions for working in the domain of linear algebra and matrices. It is an open-source project and you can use it freely. NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

✅ What is Pandas?
 Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

✅ What is Matplotlib?
Python scripts can be used to create 2D graphs and plots using the Matplotlib module. With features to control line styles, font attributes, formatting axes, and other features, it offers a module called plot that makes things simple for plotting.
